# Lambda Function Deployment and Testing

**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Topic:** AWS Lambda Deployment  
**Duration:** 3 hours

## Overview
Deployed the metadata generation Lambda function and tested its integration with S3. This function will automatically process new log files and generate the metadata.json file.

## What I Accomplished
- Created IAM role with S3 read/write permissions
- Deployed Lambda function using AWS CLI
- Configured environment variables for S3 bucket name
- Set up CloudWatch logging for debugging
- Tested function with sample log files

## Technical Details
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18.x
- **Memory:** 256 MB
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds
- **Trigger:** EventBridge rule (scheduled)

## Challenges Faced
- Initial permission issues with S3 access
- Cold start latency on first invocation
- JSON formatting in Lambda response

## Solutions Implemented
- Created dedicated IAM policy for S3 access
- Added provisioned concurrency for consistent performance
- Implemented proper error handling and logging

## Next Steps
- Set up EventBridge rule for automatic triggering
- Implement error handling for malformed log files
- Add CloudWatch alarms for monitoring

## Code Snippets
```javascript
// Key function for S3 object listing
const listParams = {
    Bucket: bucketName,
    Prefix: 'logs/'
};
const listResult = await s3.listObjectsV2(listParams).promise();
```
