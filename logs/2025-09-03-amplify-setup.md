# AWS Amplify Frontend Deployment

**Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Topic:** AWS Amplify Setup  
**Duration:** 2.5 hours

## Overview
Set up AWS Amplify to host the terminal-style frontend interface. This provides a scalable, serverless hosting solution with automatic deployments from GitHub.

## What I Accomplished
- Created Amplify app connected to GitHub repository
- Configured build settings for static site deployment
- Set up custom domain with SSL certificate
- Implemented environment-specific configurations
- Tested deployment pipeline

## Amplify Configuration
- **Framework:** Static Web App
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (placeholder)
- **Output Directory:** `frontend/`
- **Node Version:** 18.x

## Build Process
1. Clone repository from GitHub
2. Install dependencies (if any)
3. Build frontend assets
4. Deploy to S3 + CloudFront
5. Update DNS records

## Performance Optimizations
- Enabled CloudFront CDN for global distribution
- Configured caching headers for static assets
- Implemented gzip compression
- Set up custom error pages

## Security Considerations
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers configuration
- CORS settings for API calls
- Environment variable management

## Monitoring Setup
- CloudWatch integration for logs
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting

## Next Steps
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Implement automated testing
- Add performance monitoring
- Configure custom error handling
