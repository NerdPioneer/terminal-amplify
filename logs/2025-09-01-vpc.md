# VPC Setup and Configuration

**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Topic:** AWS VPC Configuration  
**Duration:** 2 hours

## Overview
Today I set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for the terminal-journal project. This is the foundation for our serverless architecture.

## What I Accomplished
- Created a custom VPC with public and private subnets
- Configured Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
- Set up security groups for Lambda functions
- Established VPC endpoints for S3 access

## Key Learnings
- VPC endpoints can significantly reduce data transfer costs
- Private subnets are essential for Lambda functions that don't need internet access
- Security groups should follow the principle of least privilege

## Next Steps
- Configure EventBridge rules for automated log processing
- Set up CloudWatch logging for monitoring
- Test Lambda function deployment in the VPC
