# Terminal Journal

A digital learning journal that documents my cybersecurity journey through an interactive terminal interface. This project helps me track my progress, share my learning experiences, and build a portfolio that grows with my skills.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

As someone transitioning co cybersecurity, I needed a way to:
- **Document my learning journey** in a structured, searchable format
- **Showcase my growing skills** to potential employers and peers
- **Practice with real-world tools** like cloud platforms and automation
- **Build something I'm proud of** while learning new technologies

This terminal-style interface makes my learning journey feel more authentic and engaging, like I'm actually working in the field I'm studying for.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### The Interface
- **Terminal Look**: Designed to look like a real command-line interface that cybersecurity professionals use daily
- **Interactive Commands**: Type commands like `help`, `logs`, `skills` to explore my journey
- **File Browser**: Click on log files in the sidebar to read about my learning experiences
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Behind the Scenes
- **Cloud Storage**: My learning logs are stored securely in the cloud
- **Automatic Updates**: When I add new learning entries, the system automatically updates the interface
- **Smart Organization**: The system categorizes my skills and projects based on what I'm learning

### Why This Approach?
I chose to build this as a web application because:
- **Accessibility**: Anyone can view it without special software
- **Real-world Skills**: I'm learning cloud platforms, automation, and web development
- **Portfolio Building**: It demonstrates my technical abilities to potential employers
- **Scalability**: As I learn more, the system can grow with my knowledge

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Visitors
1. Open the website in your browser
2. Type `help` to see available commands
3. Click on log files in the right sidebar to read about my learning journey
4. Try commands like `skills`, `projects`, or `about` to learn more

### For Developers
If you want to run this locally:
1. Download the project files
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser
3. That's it! No special setup needed

### For My Learning
I update this project by:
1. Adding new learning entries to the `logs/` folder
2. The system automatically organizes and displays them
3. I can track my progress and share my journey with others

## 📝 My Learning Journal Format

Each learning entry follows this simple structure:

**File Name**: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` (like `2025-09-01-vpc.md`)

**Content Includes**:
- **What I learned**: The main topic or skill
- **How I learned it**: Resources, courses, or hands-on practice
- **What I built**: Projects or labs I completed
- **Key insights**: Important concepts I discovered
- **Next steps**: What I want to learn next
- **Resources**: Helpful links and references

This format helps me:
- Track my progress over time
- Remember what I've learned
- Share knowledge with others
- Plan my next learning goals

## 🎓 My Cybersecurity Journey
