# Terminal Journal

A digital learning journal that documents my cybersecurity journey through an interactive terminal interface. This project helps me track my progress, share my learning experiences, and build a portfolio that grows with my skills.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

As someone transitioning co cybersecurity, I needed a way to:
- **Document my learning journey** in a structured, searchable format
- **Showcase my growing skills** to potential employers and peers
- **Practice with real-world tools** like cloud platforms and automation
- **Build something I'm proud of** while learning new technologies

This terminal-style interface makes my learning journey feel more authentic and engaging, like I'm actually working in the field I'm studying for.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### The Interface
- **Terminal Look**: Designed to look like a real command-line interface that cybersecurity professionals use daily
- **Interactive Commands**: Type commands like `help`, `logs`, `skills` to explore my journey
- **File Browser**: Click on log files in the sidebar to read about my learning experiences
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Behind the Scenes
- **Cloud Storage**: My learning logs are stored securely in Amazon S3 with encryption
- **Automatic Processing**: AWS Lambda automatically processes new entries and updates metadata
- **Smart Organization**: The system categorizes my skills and projects based on what I'm learning
- **Secure Access**: S3 signed URLs ensure only authorized users can access private content
- **Global Delivery**: CloudFront CDN makes the site fast worldwide

### Why This Approach?
I chose to build this as a web application because:
- **Accessibility**: Anyone can view it without special software
- **Real-world Skills**: I'm learning cloud platforms, automation, and web development
- **Portfolio Building**: It demonstrates my technical abilities to potential employers
- **Scalability**: As I learn more, the system can grow with my knowledge

## 🔒 AWS Backend & Security

This project will be powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide enterprise-grade security and scalability:

### Planned AWS Architecture
- **AWS Amplify**: Hosts the frontend website with automatic deployments
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes and organizes my learning logs automatically
- **Amazon S3**: Securely stores my learning journal files and metadata
- **S3 Signed URLs**: Provides secure, time-limited access to private content
- **AWS IAM**: Manages permissions and access control
- **CloudFront CDN**: Delivers content fast and securely worldwide

### Security Features
- **Encrypted Storage**: All files encrypted at rest in S3
- **Secure Access**: Signed URLs prevent unauthorized access to private content
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Lambda functions have minimal required permissions
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: All traffic encrypted in transit
- **Regular Backups**: Automated backups of all learning data

### Why AWS?
- **Industry Standard**: Most companies use AWS, so I'm learning real-world skills
- **Security First**: AWS provides enterprise-grade security features
- **Cost Effective**: Pay only for what I use as a student
- **Scalable**: Can handle growth from personal project to professional portfolio
- **Learning Opportunity**: Hands-on experience with cloud security and architecture
